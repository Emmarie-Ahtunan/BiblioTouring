# BiblioTouring

Are you tired of traditional quizzes and games that only test your knowledge of geography?

BiblioTouring is a unique online game that combines the world of books and geography! In this game, you will have to find books that match the descriptions of different locations around the world. Your goal is to find as many books as possible in the given time.

But beware! You will have to search for the books in a library that is organized in a unique way. The books are not organized by country or region, but by the author's last name. This adds an extra layer of difficulty to the game, as you will have to know both the geography and the authors of the books.

As you progress through the game, you will learn about the different libraries around the world and the unique ways they are organized. You will also learn about the different books that have been written about different locations. This will help you not only improve your geography knowledge but also your knowledge of literature and history.

So why wait? Start playing BiblioTouring today and test your knowledge of geography and literature!
